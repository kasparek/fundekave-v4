The Image transform plugin applies the image modifications supplied by the [Image crop](https://github.com/pqina/filepond-plugin-image-crop) and [Image resize](https://github.com/pqina/filepond-plugin-image-resize) plugins before the image is uploaded. It can also change the file format to either JPEG or PNG.
